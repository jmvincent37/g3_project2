 Project 2
This document provides instructions for a mini-project in which the reader is expected to create an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform data from crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx files. The transformed data will be saved in CSV files, and the CSV file data will be used to create an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data will be uploaded to a Postgres database. The instructions are divided into several subsections, including creating category and subcategory data frames, creating the campaign data frame, creating the contacts data frame, and creating the crowdfunding database. The document provides detailed instructions on how to create each data frame, as well as how to sketch an ERD and create a table schema for the CSV files. The document also emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication between group members and provides guidelines for working with a partner on this project.
